Template Linked List Implementation

This project is a C++ implementation of a template linked list structure. 
It also has a menu that allows you to maintain the linked list with pointers to 
Shape objects, which is the base class of some different shape classes (such as Cricle, Square etc.) 
which are the derived classes.
This allows for the linked list to store objects of different shapes types.


The menu allows the following actions:

Insert: Add a new node to the linked list
Delete: Remove a node from the start of the linked list
Print: Display the shapes and its details
Exit: Exit the program

Note - the template classes are implemented in the header file and don't have source files,
to avoid compilation errors.
